    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>Exploration geologist with over 6 years of experience in both green field and brown field gold exploration.
        Currently fulfilling the role of Senior Field Geologist at Zijin Rosebel Goldmines N.V. in the Regional Exploration department, with interests in structural geology and geophysics.</p>
        
       <p>My first professional experience was during my undergraduate BSc. internship at the petrophysics department at Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V. where I had a great opportunity to learn how physical characteristics can be used to interpret the geology of the subsurface which started my interest in geophysics.</p> 
       
        <p>During my 5 years with IAMGOLD Rosebel N.V. and currently with Zijin Rosebel Goldmines N.V., I have been lucky to be involved in the exploration for new gold deposits in areas with limited data where geological interpretation with the available data would play a major role in driving the exploration; and to also contribute to developing advanced projects to the resource stage such as the Saramacca gold deposit.</p>
